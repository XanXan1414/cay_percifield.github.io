        <p>I had just abandoned ship. Capitalist war machine AT&T decided to cut commissions to authorized retailers in half. I had warned my team in time and we all found new jobs, in fact I was one of the last to leave.</p>
        <p>My new job was working for an awesome dude named Jeremy at Office Depot. If AT&T was a Capitalist war machine, Office Depot was a sinking Lusitania punctured by the torpedos of online retailers. "No that salary figure on GlassDoor takes into account the whole country like people in Alaska who need a bigger salary due to cost of living, a loaf of bread is like 10 bucks there I don't even make that kind of money....I'll be honest our sales are rough we won't bonus for at least a year". I accepted as soon as he extended the offer, the pay sucked, but the honesty was worth 100 bull $%*t promises of big easy money.  </p>

        <p>After a depressing couple months wandering the isles of OD watching rich people berate sweet old ladies who happened to bet on the wrong employer I started looking harder than ever for a way out. I sold and fixed computers for OD, primarily to old folks who didn't know enought to realize that they had been charged 100$ to let a kid use the free version of software we will call "badware nibbles" to get the viruses off their computer. I thought to myself "I'm a smart guy why use this brain to manipulate people into buying electronics when I could develop the stuff that goes into them!".  So with hesitant confidence in my heart I googled how to learn to code and landed here on Kahn Academy. Now I'm kicking it with Pam and prepping for a coding bootcamp that, with any luck, will be my rope ladder attached to a helicopter that rescues me off the rooftop of retail and into the middle class!
